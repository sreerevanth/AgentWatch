"""AgentWatch live demo — watch it stop a dangerous agent in seconds.

Run it with no setup at all::

    pip install agentwatch-ai
    python demo.py

No Docker, no ``.env``, no API keys. It uses AgentWatch's built-in safety
auditor (zero config) to inspect each step a simulated agent tries to run, and
blocks the destructive one *before* it would execute.
