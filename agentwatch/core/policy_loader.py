"""Discover, load, scaffold, and apply local safety-policy files (issue #340).

A repository can carry a ``.agentwatch-safety.yml`` (the ``policy_dsl`` ``rules:``
schema) to customize how commands are treated by ``agentwatch safety check``.
This module provides:

* discovery — cwd first, then ``~/.agentwatch`` — via :func:`discover_policy_file`;
* loading via :func:`load_policy_engine` (delegates to ``PolicyEngine.from_yaml``);
* a scaffold template (:data:`DEFAULT_POLICY_YAML`) for ``safety config generate``;
* a pure, testable :func:`combine` that overlays a custom policy decision on a
  builtin risk verdict.

The combine step deliberately lives here (pure) rather than in the security-
critical ``SafetyEngine._evaluate_safety`` runtime path, so ``safety check`` can
honor a local policy without changing runtime enforcement behavior.
