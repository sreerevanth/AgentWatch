"""Aggregate agent sessions into a grouped cost report (issue #339).

This module is deliberately pure and side-effect free: :func:`build_cost_report`
takes a list of already-time-filtered :class:`AgentSession` summaries and returns
a :class:`CostReport`. Fetching sessions (from the API) and rendering (Rich table
or JSON) live in the CLI layer, which keeps the aggregation trivially testable.

Design choices (the issue left these open):
* USD comes from the pre-computed ``session.estimated_cost_usd`` — no per-model
  pricing lookup is needed at report time.
* A "successful goal" is a session whose stored ``status`` is
  ``ExecutionStatus.SUCCESS``. Session summaries do not carry their events, so an
  events-based (dual-eval) definition is intentionally out of scope here.
