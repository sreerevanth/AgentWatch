CST-009 — Cost-Aware Model Router (issue #375, CST-004 cost-intelligence scope).

Route a task to the cheapest model capable of handling its complexity: simple
subtasks go to cheap models (e.g. Gemini Flash), and expensive, advanced models
are reserved for genuinely complex work — optimizing the project budget.

Builds on the :data:`~agentwatch.cost.comparator.DEFAULT_PRICING` table (CST-002)
as the single source of truth for rates; this module adds the complexity scoring
and capability-aware selection on top.
