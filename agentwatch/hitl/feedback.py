"""Bounded feedback learning for HITL thresholds.

This is deliberately a small, explainable heuristic rather than an opaque model:
it tracks, per risk level, how often humans approve vs. reject REVIEW requests.
When a level's approval rate is consistently very high over a meaningful sample,
that level is a candidate for *relaxation* (humans keep approving it, so blocking
review may be unnecessary overhead). When rejections are common, the level is a
candidate for *tightening*. The learner only ever *suggests* changes and can
optionally apply them within fixed bounds; it never silently escalates a level
past REVIEW or relaxes CRITICAL below REVIEW.
