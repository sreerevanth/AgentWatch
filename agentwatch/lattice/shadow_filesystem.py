"""In-memory filesystem simulation for the v2 state lattice.

The lattice decides whether an action is safe by working out what it *would* do, rather than by
pattern-matching the command that requests it. This module is the filesystem half of that: given a
:class:`FileAction`, it reports the path that would change, how it would change, and whether the
target sits inside a critical system directory.

Nothing here touches the disk. That is the point of the class, not an implementation detail, so two
things are worth spelling out:

* The set of paths believed to exist is supplied by the caller and held in memory. The simulator
  never scans, stats, opens or writes anything.
* Path normalisation goes through :func:`os.path.normpath`, which is pure string work.
  :meth:`pathlib.Path.resolve` is deliberately avoided: it stats the filesystem to follow symlinks,
  which would be real I/O.
