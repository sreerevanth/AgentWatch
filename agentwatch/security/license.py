"""
CMP — Premium entitlement verification and license enforcement.

Premium features are unlocked by an *entitlement token*: a JWT signed by the
AgentWatch backend with an RS256 private key and verified here against the
matching public key. Verification is asymmetric, so the CLI only ever holds the
public key and cannot mint tokens of its own.

This module is the client-side verification primitive. It does **not** decide
*which* features are premium, nor does it replace server-side enforcement —
the most robust gate is to have the backend perform premium work only for a
valid token (see issue #405). What it provides is a single, cryptographically
checked entry point (:func:`verify_entitlement`) so that premium gating is a
signature check rather than a patchable ``if is_premium()`` boolean.

PyJWT is an optional dependency (the ``crypto`` extra). Verification raises a
clear :class:`LicenseError` if it is missing rather than failing open.
