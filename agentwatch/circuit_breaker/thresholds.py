class CircuitThresholds:
    """Thresholds that decide when the breaker trips from CLOSED to OPEN.

    All thresholds are evaluated over the window of events observed since the
    breaker last entered the CLOSED state (a successful recovery resets the
    counters). A threshold of ``0`` or ``None`` disables that particular check.

    Attributes:
        max_total_tokens: Trip once cumulative tokens across observed events
            exceed this value. Guards runaway generation cost.
        max_consecutive_errors: Trip once this many error/failure events occur
            in a row (a success resets the run).
        max_total_errors: Trip once this many error/failure events occur in
            total within the window, even if interspersed with successes.
        max_hallucinations: Trip once this many low-confidence / anomaly-flagged
            events are observed within the window.
        min_confidence: Any single event whose confidence ``overall_score`` is
            strictly below this value counts as a hallucination signal. Set to
            ``0.0`` to disable per-event confidence checking.
        half_open_probe_successes: Number of consecutive successful probe events
            required in HALF_OPEN before the breaker closes again.
