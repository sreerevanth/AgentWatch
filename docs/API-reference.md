# AgentWatch API and SDK Reference

Welcome to the central reference for the AgentWatch observability, safety, and reliability ecosystem. This document serves as the single source of truth for interacting with AgentWatch, whether you are utilizing the Python SDK directly inside your agent frameworks or communicating via our REST API endpoints.

## Response Conventions

This section describes what the API does today, so a new route has something to conform to. It is a
description, not a proposal — everything below was checked against the running application, including
the parts that are inconsistent.

### Success responses have no envelope

Payloads are returned at the top level. There is no `data` wrapper, no `success` flag, no metadata
block.

```http
GET /api/v1/dashboard/summary
200 OK

{
  "total_sessions": 12,
  "active_sessions": 3,
  "blocked_sessions": 1,
  "estimated_cost_usd": 0.42
}
```

A new route should return its payload directly and let the status code carry the success/failure
signal.

Five routes declare a `response_model` (`SessionListResponse`, `PruneResponse`, `TraceResponse`,
`ConfidenceResponse`, `SafetyCheckResponse`); the other thirty return plain dictionaries or
`model_dump()` output. Declaring a `response_model` is preferable for anything new — it validates the
response, and it is what populates the OpenAPI schema that clients generate from.

### Error responses come in three shapes

This is the part worth knowing before you write a client, because **a single error parser will not
work**.

**Most errors** — 400, 404, 500 — use FastAPI's default handler, where `detail` is a string:

```http
GET /api/v1/sessions/does-not-exist
404 Not Found

{ "detail": "Session does-not-exist not found" }
```

**Validation errors** (422) reuse the same key with a *different type*. `detail` is a list of objects,
not a string:

```http
GET /api/v1/sessions?limit=9999
422 Unprocessable Entity

{
  "detail": [
    {
      "type": "less_than_equal",
      "loc": ["query", "limit"],
      "msg": "Input should be less than or equal to 200"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Rate limiting** (429) uses a different key entirely — `error`, not `detail`:

```http
429 Too Many Requests

{ "error": "rate_limit_exceeded" }
```

That last one comes from the custom handler in `server.py`; the other two are FastAPI's defaults.

So a client reading errors has to check `detail` as a string, `detail` as a list, and `error`. That is
the current contract. It is worth documenting precisely because it is the sort of thing that gets
harder to change the more clients depend on it — and any consolidation would be a breaking change, so
it belongs in a deliberate decision rather than a drive-by fix.

### Status codes in use

| code | meaning | used by |
|---|---|---|
| `200` | success | all successful reads and writes |
| `400` | malformed request the schema can't catch | 3 routes |
| `404` | the named resource does not exist | 10 routes |
| `422` | request failed schema validation | raised automatically by FastAPI |
| `429` | rate limit exceeded | the rate-limit middleware |
| `500` | unhandled server-side failure | 2 routes |

There is no `201` on creation and no `204` on deletion — creates and deletes return `200` with a body.
Match that rather than introducing a new convention in a single route.

### Pagination

List endpoints take a `limit` query parameter with a server-side ceiling, and nothing else:

| endpoint | default | max |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/sessions` | 50 | 200 |
| `GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}/events` | 500 | 2000 |
| `GET /api/v1/safety/blocked` | 50 | 200 |

**There is no `offset`, no `page` and no cursor.** Once a collection exceeds the ceiling, the rest of it
is not reachable through the API. Exceeding the maximum is a `422`, not a silent clamp.

If you add a list endpoint, follow the `limit` + `le=` pattern so the behaviour stays predictable. If
you need to page beyond the ceiling, that is a design change worth raising as an issue rather than
solving locally in one route.

### Rate-limit headers

Every response — including successful ones and the `429` itself — carries four headers:

```
X-RateLimit-User-Limit        X-RateLimit-User-Remaining
X-RateLimit-Global-Limit      X-RateLimit-Global-Remaining
```

Per-user and global budgets are tracked separately, so a client can be rejected by the global limit
while its own budget is untouched. Clients should read both.


## Python SDK Reference

To start monitoring your AI agents, make sure you import the core functions from the root package:

'''python
import agentwatch'''

Core SDK Methods
1. agentwatch.watch
What it does: This is the primary entry point for AgentWatch. It dynamically attaches monitoring hooks to an active AI agent instance. Once wrapped, it automatically streams execution trace events, logs performance metrics, and applies active safety policies in real time.

Returns: The monitored, safety wrapped agent instance.

2. agentwatch.detect_framework
What it does: Inspects a live runtime object to identify which orchestration library is being used behind the scenes.

Supported Frameworks: Dynamically identifies popular frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI, and AutoGen.

Returns: A reference to the identified framework adapter class.

3. agentwatch.detect_framework_label
What it does: A helper method that identifies the running agent framework and returns a clean, human readable string such as langchain, crewai, or autogen.

Returns: A string label.

4. agentwatch.GenericAdapter
What it does: The base adapter class used for parsing agent lifecycles. If you are running an in house or unsupported agent framework, you can subclass GenericAdapter to build custom telemetry parsing logic.

SDK Exceptions
agentwatch.AgentWatchBlockedError
What it does: This exception is instantly raised at runtime if an agent action, reasoning step, or tool invocation violates your active safety guardrails, such as attempting an illegal file system command.

REST API Endpoints
Authentication and Security Governance
The API uses three clear authentication and authorization mechanisms depending on your account setup and environment settings.

API Key Access
For standard automated client telemetry tracking data ingestion:

Header Key: X-Api-Key

Value: Your secret API key string

SAML SSO and Role Based Access Control
For dashboard interactions and operational endpoints when the SAML secret configuration is active:

Header Key: Authorization

Value: Bearer your_saml_session_token_here

Premium Feature Entitlements
Certain advanced endpoints require a premium tier verification token to validate your software license configuration and avoid bypass attempts:

Header Key: X-Entitlement-Token

Value: Your cryptographically signed license entitlement string

Optional Header Key: X-Machine-Id (A text-based unique identifier string passed along as a basic machine validation sanity check)

Role Hierarchy Enforcements
When SAML single sign on is enabled, security profiles are categorized and ordered by minimum privileges:

Viewer tier

Operator tier

Admin tier

Owner tier
