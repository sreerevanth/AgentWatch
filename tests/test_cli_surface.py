"""Characterisation test for the CLI surface.

This exists to make the CLI refactor in #600 reviewable.

`agentwatch/cli/main.py` is being split into per-family modules. The point of that change is that it
is *behaviour-preserving*: same commands, same flags, same defaults, same help. But "I didn't change
anything" is not a claim a reviewer can check by reading a 2,500-line diff that moves code between
files.

So this records the whole CLI surface into a golden file. Rename a command, drop one, change an
option's default, make an argument required, alter a help string — any of it turns this red with a
diff. Move code between modules all you like; the moment the interface shifts, you know.

**On why it inspects the Click objects rather than snapshotting `--help`.** The `--help` route is the
obvious one and it does not work. That output goes through Rich, which wraps text at points that
differ between Windows and Linux even with `COLUMNS` pinned, draws panels with box characters the
Windows console encoding cannot represent, and prints the program name as `agentwatch.EXE` on Windows.
None of that is the CLI's contract, and a golden file full of it fails on whichever platform did not
generate it. A test that goes red for cosmetic reasons is one people learn to ignore.

Reading the command objects sidesteps the rendering entirely, and records *more* than `--help` shows:
parameter types, defaults, and whether each is required.

To update the golden file after a *deliberate* CLI change:

    UPDATE_CLI_SURFACE=1 pytest tests/test_cli_surface.py

and commit the diff, so the change to the public interface is explicit in review.
