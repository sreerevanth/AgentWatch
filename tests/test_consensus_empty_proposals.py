"""Regression tests for MAG-007 consensus with empty proposals.

Issue #541: empty/whitespace proposals embed to a zero vector and
cosine(zero, zero) == 0, so identical empty proposals never clustered — an
all-silent round was reported as maximal disagreement (N singletons). They must
be grouped as identical, and an all-empty round is not an actionable consensus.
