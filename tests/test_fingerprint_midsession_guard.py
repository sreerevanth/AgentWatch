"""Regression tests for RSN-008 fingerprint mid-session-change false positives.

Issue #538: detect_mid_session_change() must not flag a mid-session model change
when one half of the session simply has no PLANNER_OUTPUT events to fingerprint
(the all-zeros sentinel from fingerprint() means "no signal", not "changed").
